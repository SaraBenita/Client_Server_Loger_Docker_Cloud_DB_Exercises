# Cloud Basics Exercise

## Summary
This exercise extended the work done in the Docker exercise by deploying the containerized server to a cloud platform. The goal was to expose the server for public use via a 24/7 accessible URL.

## Objectives
- Deploy the Dockerized server to a cloud provider.
- Ensure the server is publicly accessible and functions correctly.

## Technologies Used
- Docker: For containerization.
- Google Cloud Platform.
- HTTP: For API validation.

**Deployment:**
  - Configured the cloud environment to run the Docker container.
  - Deployed the container and ensured it was accessible via a public URL.

**Validation:**
 - Used HTTP requests to test the endpoints.
 - Ensured the server responded correctly with an empty initial state.
